> Although this archetype has been around in the game for several months, with the arrival of new cards in the Fallen Age expansion, some new additions have further enhanced this deck. Those who already had it made it even stronger, and...

| @aubryd | [All Hydras in Gods Unchained.](https://peakd.com/hive-173286/@aubryd/all-hydras-in-gods-unchained) |
<p></p>

An amusing post where the author goes over the entire roster of cards in Gods Unchained to find just the Hydras, their synergies and how they can be used in decks. This post is part of an interesting series where the author goes some of the cards in the game thematically, makes connections to other TCGs and sometimes offers ideas for new cards of the same theme.

> I really love the art of the cards, and also the name of the cards is very interesting. When the Fallen Age Expansion was released, I took a look in the Gods Unchained cards, and I found out that there are a lot of cards that I didn't even know existed. Most of these are...

<p></p>

A thorough and detailed tier list with commentary of the new cards in the Fallen Age expansion. Always a popular and useful opinion post when new expansions come out.

> Gods Unchained's newest expansion, Fallen Age, is coming out on February 18 and introduces 56 new cards designed to to shake up the meta and add support for old archetypes.<br>With it comes two new mechanics: Wither and Raid. Cards with wither are obliterated at the end of the owner's turn, providing you with a temporary resource or disrupting your opponent by giving wither to cards in their hand. Raid is triggered when...

<p></p>

A very creative and interesting post where the author shares some custom card ideas for Death and Deception, focused on player interaction. The author explains the design process and the ideas behind each card, as well as their potential synergies and uses in decks.

> Gods Unchained is really good. However, there are not a lot of interaction between each players, unlike most TCG games. It would be really cool to have some of the interactions, since currently GU is filled with aggro/combo.<br>In this post, I will be creating some of custom GU cards, along with some keywords that will try to give players more interaction. I will be dividing each cards by Domains, and create...

<p></p>

Another development newsletter from gumeta, a community website with many tools and resources useful to all Gods Unchained players. This time the author goes over the new Sealed overview feature, the impact of the new expansion and Battle Pass on the number of active players, Sealed meta overview and finally some tips for playing effectively in Sealed mode.

> Because last time I did quite a job adjusting code to display decks, today I thought, why not include sealed games as well? The idea came to me when I bought the shiny Battle Pass, which includes two 'free' tickets, so I 'have to' play two sealed runs. But I have no idea what is working right now in sealed...

> Spending some more time on Reddit because, of course, where else would I be on a Friday?<br>What started as a quick look at discussions about Gods Unchained turned into yet another full session of reading strange debates. I've mentioned here before how the use of AI-generated art in the game isnâ€™t as big of a deal as some make it out to be. After all, if it speeds up the release of new cards and allows the devs to focus on other aspects of the game, then thereâ€™s a real benefit to...
