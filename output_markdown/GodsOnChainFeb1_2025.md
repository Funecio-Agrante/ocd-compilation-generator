| @imx.center | [Gumeta Update: Deck Codes!](https://peakd.com/hive-173286/@imx.center/gumeta-update-deck-codes) |
<p></p>

An important update that matters to every player using Gumeta (seriously, that should literally be everyone) bringing deck codes for easy import into the game client or any other place you need.

> Did I say no more updates on Gumeta? I probably meant less focus on Gumeta development :)<br>To be honest, with the new Battle Pass and recent improvements in Gods Unchained, the future looks bright and I found new motivation to make Gumeta even better.<br>This is a feature many of you were waiting for, especially...

<p></p>

A bit of a mixed-bag post, but includes a replay of an interesting match, and especially interesting is the usage of GIFs to illustrate important gameplay moments.

<p></p>

A rather short post, but the true value lies in the 1 hour and 28 minutes video where the author goes through a detailed review of the upcoming expansion Fallen Age.

<p></p>

A very creative, out-of-the-beaten-path idea for a Light deck using some infamous and also seldom-used cards. It takes a special kind of talent to come up with ideas like this.

> Yes, it's a overheal light deck with BOTC. But I've been told it is more fun to play against than the norm, there is an interplay of bodies and removals not just Lysander sitting all by himself tossing spells left and right. Sadly cards like heiragon and prophet of progress require...

<p></p>

Do you need to buy expensive cards to be competitive? Maybe not, and this author will explain why, and offer some examples!

In this post authored by me, I explain how the Elderytch Mysteries work, a group of cards for the Magic God in the Dread Awakening expansion set.
