This post is part of an interesting series where the author goes through some of the cards in the game thematically, makes connections to other TCGs and sometimes offers ideas for new cards of the same theme.",
            "preview": "I really love the art of the cards, and also the name of the cards is very interesting. When the Fallen Age Expansion was released, I took a look in the Gods Unchained cards, and I found out that there are a lot of cards that I didn't even know existed. Most of these are"

            "preview": "Gods Unchained's newest expansion, Fallen Age, is coming out on February 18 and introduces 56 new cards designed to shake up the meta and add support for old archetypes.<br>With it comes two new mechanics: Wither and Raid. Cards with wither are obliterated at the end of the owner's turn, providing you with a temporary resource or disrupting your opponent by giving wither to cards in their hand. Raid is triggered when"

            "preview": "Gods Unchained is really good. However, there are not a lot of interaction between each players, unlike most TCG games. It would be really cool to have some of the interactions, since currently GU is filled with aggro/combo.<br>In this post, I will be creating some of custom GU cards, along with some keywords that will try to give players more interaction. I will be dividing each cards by Domains, and create"

            "preview": "Because last time I did quite a job adjusting code to display decks, today I thought, why not include sealed games as well? The idea came to me when I bought the shiny Battle Pass, which includes two 'free' tickets, so I 'have to' play two sealed runs. But I have no idea what is working right now in sealed"

I've mentioned here before how the use of AI-generated art in the game isn’t as big of a deal as some make it out to be.
